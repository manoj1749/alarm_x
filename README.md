# Alarm X

This alarm app is the ultimate solution for waking up. While most people tend to turn off their alarms and go back to sleep, this app requires you to complete a task before it stops, ensuring that you are fully awake.

Group alarms can also be set, allowing you to wake up together with your friends and family. This is especially useful for people who have to wake up early for work or school.

### 1. Alarm Setting <br>
You have the flexibility to set alarms for any desired time with an added buffer time. The buffer time provides you with a specific duration to complete the assigned task in order to turn off the alarm. If the task is not completed within the buffer time, the alarm will ring again after the buffer time.

### 2. Group Alarm Setting <br>
You can also set group alarms with your family or friends. Each member of the group will be required to complete the assigned task within the buffer time in order to turn off the alarm. If any member fails to complete the task within the buffer time, the alarm will ring again after the buffer time. In case some members complete the task and others don't, the remaining members will be notified, and a secondary alarm can be sent to them.

### 3. Alarm Task Setting <br>
You have the option to choose from different tasks to complete in order to turn off the alarm. The available tasks include walking a few steps, solving a simple math problem, or using your phone for a few minutes.
